# R-script-parasitism
Analysing parasitim data of Youn's postdoc

This repo contains data and code needed to perform the analyses and figures in our manuscript:

"Not defined yet" (by Youn Henry, Jesper Wallisch, Paula Rodriguez, Sandro Ginesi, Maxime Dahirel & Christoph Vorburger)

data in .txt format are in the data folder, R script in Rmd format (including detailed information about the analysis) in the R folder.

This folder is a RStudio project folder, and the script uses the here package (see also here). This means all file paths are relative, and the analysis should work on your computer no questions asked, whether you use the R project or not, no code line to change as long as you download the entire repo (you just need to install all the needed packages first, of course).

If you run the script for the first time, models and some other time-consuming outputs will be saved in the R_output folder so you don't have to re-run them everytime.
